# DFA-Language-Emptiness
This project will implement an algorithm to determine if the language accepted by a given deterministic finite automaton (DFA) is empty. A DFA's language, L(M), is the set of all strings that the machine accepts. The language is considered empty if the DFA accepts no strings.
